# Recycling-at-the-Big-House
This project is about waste management at football games. Football is at the heart of our school and is ingrained in our campusâ€™ culture. However, we must not forget that as a school, the University of Michigan needs to be environmentally conscious of what such a large, energetic environment can create at times. We hope to create a rough sketch of what programs we should implement at the Big House. The data that we will be using will be either be sourced from Michigan Websites and measuring the dimensions of objects ourselves. We will be making assumptions on a variable to variable basis if we are unable to source the data. The way we will be making assumptions is by conducting surveys and weighting importance of specific variables based off of survey results. We use the simplex method to find the most optimal solution.
